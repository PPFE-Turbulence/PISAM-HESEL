# PISAM-HESEL
PISAM is a full 3D discrete particle model tailored for modeling deuterium atoms and molecules in fusion plasma.
PISAM has been coupled with the 2D turbulent edge plasma model HESEL. PISAM is implemented in Python while HESEL is implement in the C++ framework BOUT++. The two codes are coupled using MPI.
